## Question 1 - 
I did attempt Question 1 with some help from https://github.com/VivekPa/BinomialOptModel. 
The .py file contains only the code for the Price function.
## Question 2 - 
For my Backtesting model, I've used RSI in combination with ADX for approximately 700 trading days for Apple Stock. 
Return of investment is close to 200%. 
## Question 3 - 
For the 3rd question, I've first scraped the top 20 Nasdaq stocks and then applied Markowitz Essential Frontier and assign weights to further reduce to 10. 
I've then implemented Pearson Co-efficient to find correlations strictly between Closing Prices. 
A seaborn Heatmap then is an easy graphical solution to reduce from 10 to 5. 
For few stocks, correlations are sometimes higher beacause all of them were top performers in the first place.
